## Course Content

### Course Orientation & Outline

The Course Orientation and accompanying readings, will acquaint you with the practice of mindfulness and how it can help you to deal more effectively with stress. You will learn how this secular, scientific, evidence-based practice has become an accepted part of mainstream medicine, and discover how it can positively affect the quality of your everyday life.

### Week 1

The course materials will provide you with an overview of the course and establishes the learning context for the rest of your experience. You will learn the theory and evidence of mind-body medicine and how to apply it in your life. You'll be experientially introduced to mindful eating, mindful breathing, and the body-scan method, with a special emphasis on what it means to be fully engaged in the present moment.

### Week 2

The course materials will provide you with an understanding of how and why perception is key in mindfulness—how you see things (or don't see them) will determine to a large extent how you respond. This week's session and practices will ask you to examine your perceptions, assumptions, and the way you view the world. You will learn to use the body-scan practice to cultivate a greater degree of awareness of how you react to stressful situations. Changing the way you perceive and respond to difficulties and challenges will impact the short- and long-term effects of stress on your mind and body.

### Week 3

The course materials will help you to discover that there is both pleasure and power in being present. You will directly attend to and investigate how your experiences create such reactions as pleasure or discomfort in the mind and body.

### Week 4

The course materials will provide you with a sense of how practicing mindfulness enables us to cultivate curiosity and openness to the full range of our experience, and through this process our ability to pay attention becomes more flexible. This week, your practice will focus on the development of your ability to concentrate and systematically expand your field of awareness. You'll learn about the physiological and psychological bases of stress reactivity, and experience mindful strategies for responding in positive, proactive ways to stressful situations.

### Week 5

At the halfway point in this course, you should now be familiar with the foundations of mindfulness and able to focus on applying it more rapidly and effectively to specific challenges and stressors in your life. The course materials for this week will help you to begin to pay attention to the places where you might be stuck in repeating, unhealthy patterns that you can disarm through mindful awareness. You will also learn how to apply mindfulness at the critical moment when you experience a physical sensation, intense emotion, or condition, with special attention to exploring the effect of reactivity in health and illness.

### Week 6

The course materials will provide you with an understanding of the term “resilience” or “stress hardiness” - the ability to return to equilibrium after stressful situations. This week, you will focus on transformational coping strategies to broaden your inner resources and enhance your resilience through mindfulness practice. You'll also learn the fundamentals of interpersonal mindfulness—applying awareness and presence at times when communication becomes difficult or fraught with strong emotions. You'll gain direct experience of a variety of styles for more effective and creative interpersonal communication.

### Week 7

The course materials will provide guidance with regard to the many ways that you can integrate mindfulness more fully and personally into your life. While having a dedicated regular practice for mindfulness meditation is important and beneficial, it is just as important to bring a broader sense of awareness and presence to every moment in your life, and to use non-judgmental mindfulness in your self-reflection and decision-making processes. You'll learn how to maintain the discipline and flexibility of daily practice as circumstances change over the course of your life. Mindfulness is most effective when it is a lifetime commitment.

### Week 8

The course materials will provide a review of what you have learned over the course, with an emphasis on carrying the momentum you've built forward into the coming months and years. You'll learn about some of the many resources and support options that are available to assist you in pursuing mindfulness as your life and practice evolve, and as you continue to integrate, learn, and grow. The final lesson helps to create closure by honoring both the end of this program and the beginning of the rest of your life.
