## Course Orientation

This course focuses on building one’s ability to be aware of everything that happens within and outside of oneself as it happens; including both the pleasant and the not-so-pleasant. This might be thought of as learning to be mindful. This new ‘state of mind’ will bring benefits to almost everything that you do including how you deal with stress.

### What is mindfulness?

There are numerous understandings of the term "Mindfulness". Many would agree, however, that it is a particular state of mind congruent with the definition provided by Diana Winston (UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center) who states that mindfulness is about:

<blockquote style="font-size: 18px;line-height:1.5">
  Paying attention to present moment experience with open curiosity
  and a willingness to be with what is.
</blockquote>

There has been over **40 years** of peer-reviewed research concerning the psychological and other health and medical benefits of mindful meditation. MBSR Research Summary is a very limited summary compiled by the University of Massachusetts Medical Center of the research that validates the practice of mindfulness.

### Theory and practice

This course includes both theory and practical experience. The daily mindfulness “exercises”, or practices as they are often called, are the most important component. You can’t learn to surf only by reading books about surfboards and waves, and learning how to develop a mindfulness practice is no different from any other skill that involves both mind and body. You probably know from your own experience in learning to do something, such as to play a new sport, or cook a particular meal, etc., that practice is important. Your body/mind is a very complex system and it takes time and practice to change how you use it.

As such, I recommend that you make about **30 minutes** available each day for practice. This might be the biggest obstacle you face in getting started because you may already feel that you do not have enough time for all that needs to be done in a day. Many course participants, however, have said that although their time to "do things" is technically 30 minutes less, there is a feeling of having more time, even in a very busy life.

Each week, there will be a **video** to watch, **readings** to do, and mindfulness practices (**recordings**) to engage with on a daily basis. I suggest that you choose a day of the week in which it is possible to make about **1.5 hours** available (for the next 8 weeks). On this day each week you should watch the video, engage with the ‘formal’ Mindfulness practice and, if there is time, skim through the week's readings.

### Your course objectives and intentions

It is important to think about what it is that you hope to achieve or gain as a result of doing this course. As examples, you may hope for a more effective way of dealing with stress, better ways to cope with difficult life situations, and/or an improved ability to manage your anger and other difficult emotions.

### What do you hope to achieve as a result of participating on this course?

The **Setting Intentions Worksheet** (page 4) will help you to answer this question and will create the foundation for your practice over the next eight weeks. Please take time to complete the worksheet. This is especially important because it can be difficult to build and sustain a new daily routine / practice, and you will definitely improve your chances of staying with this if you are clear about your intentions for the course.

### Course materials

#### Videos

For each week of the course there is a **Video** in which I will provide you with up-to-date information on one or more topics that relate to dealing with stress, building your ability to obtain maximum enjoyment from your life and, in general, developing a mindful state of mind.

Each week, the length of the video will vary, but will usually be between 30 and 45 minutes. It’s a good idea to reserve enough time at the beginning of the week to watch each video in one sitting.

#### Readings

For each week there are a number of **Core Readings** (i.e. articles) that have been formatted for easy reading, and are ready to be printed if you wish. For each week, you will find teachings by world-wide experts in mindfulness, which will motivate and inform the week's topics. Try at least to skim the readings at the beginning of the week, and plan to read them in their entirety by the end of the week.

Each week’s course materials will also include a number of articles that have been termed “**Extra Readings**”. These are full of useful ideas, but should definitely not be given priority over the practices if you are limited for time.

#### Formal Practices (and Recordings)

Each day of the course you will listen to a recording of one or other Formal practice (i.e. mindfulness meditation)of about 30 minutes in length, and each week introduces a new practice. After each practice, it is often useful to take two minutes or so to reflect on your experience of the practice, using that week's Formal Practice **log sheet** as a guide.

As you proceed through the course and become more familiar with the meditations, you may find that you prefer not to listen to a particular recording but rather to do the

meditation in silence. Also, it’s best to reserve enough time at the beginning of each day, or at some other suitable time during the day, to listen to each recording in one sitting.

#### Informal Practices

In addition to the Formal Practices, there are also the Informal Practices, each of which involve a brief moment of mindfulness and which will really help you to integrate mindfulness into every aspect of your daily life.

Unlike the formal practice, you don't have to schedule this into your day, it's simply about having an intention to bring a special awareness into some of the activities that you already do on a daily basis. At the end of each day, it is often beneficial to take just five minutes or so to reflect on your engagement with the informal practice during the day, using that week's Informal Practice log sheet as a guide.

And although the Informal Practices may look less important than the 30 minutes of scheduled Formal Practice, it is through the Informal Practice that you will see and realize the concrete and natural benefits of the learnings and practices of MBSR.

You may also benefit from keeping a "Mindfulness Journal" to write your impressions in a more free-form manner than the practice “log sheets” allow.

#### Creating a Course Manual

You are welcome to put together a ring binder with materials from the course for reference and review. If you print the Introduction page for each week as well as each of the "Core Readings" for that week, you will create your own comprehensive MBSR manual.

#### Online interaction with Alistair

During the course of this program, it is possible that uncomfortable feelings or unpleasant memories may arise. It is important that you take care of your own emotional and mental health. Please keep me and/or your therapist (if you are currently seeing one) informed of any difficult/uncomfortable experience as you go along, so that we may monitor any unexpected reactions to the material & practices presented.

If you would like my assistance at any point during the course then you are most welcome to set up one or more 20 minute online sessions with me using my email address: **[howickpsychologist@gmail.com](mailto:howickpsychologist@gmail.com)** or my cell phone number: **[066 269 8229](tel:+27662698229)**.
