As is the case with many health professionals whose work is influenced by life events, I too have embraced my personal experiences alongside new research and trends during my career as a psychologist.

My own experience of a chronic health problem - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) - and a regularly fluctuating mood drove me to delve deeply into the underlying causes of these common problems. This has led me to focus less on symptoms and diagnoses with clients, and to give more attention to the possible causes of an individual’s emotional difficulties and/or general health problems. Such causes often include unprocessed childhood experiences, a dysregulated nervous system, current interpersonal relationships, movement and exercise habits, food choices, and sleep patterns, amongst other factors.

My professional life has been spent talking and listening to people from all walks of life, making sense of complex information, incorporating current clinical research findings into my practice, and collaborating with other health professionals, all with the focused intention of helping people implement lasting, positive change in their lives.
