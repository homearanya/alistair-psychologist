Specific therapeutic practices will help to rewire your nervous system so that your body’s inherent self-healing abilities are optimised.

Chronic health problems often become entrenched because of a number of underlying factors. These might include poorly managed chronic stress, unresolved trauma, long-term unhealthy eating habits, a lack of regular exercise, and poor sleep hygiene amongst others. Medical research shows that an unhealthy or dysregulated nervous system also commonly plays a key role in the development of chronic health conditions.

In working together we will identify which of the many possible underlying factors have played a role in your particular chronic health problem/s.  And then, with overall health restoration our goal, I will support and assist you in slowly ensuring that your nervous system is functioning as it should while strengthening your body’s inherent self-healing abilities.
